# Policies

This folder contains **authoritative rules and constraints** for the repository.

If a policy conflicts with design, reference, or process documentation, **policy takes precedence**.

---

## Policy Groups

### AI Behavior

Rules that constrain how AI agents (Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT) operate.

- `AI/README.md` — entry point for all AI policy documents

---

### Code & Runtime Conventions

Project-wide behavioral standards.

- `TimeFormatting.md` — when to use countdown vs duration formatting

---

## Guidance

- Treat policies as **hard constraints**, not suggestions.
- Update existing policy rather than creating overlapping rules.
- Keep policies concise, explicit, and stable.
