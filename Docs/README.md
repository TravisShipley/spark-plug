2. `Architecture/README.md` for runtime architecture and ownership docs.
3. `Architecture/MentalModel.md` for the core "modifiers-first" mental model.
4. `Data/README.md` for schema and content-reference docs.
5. `Data/DatasheetGuide.md` for tab-by-tab spreadsheet authoring guidance.

## Notes

- Policy docs are authoritative when they conflict with design/reference/process docs.
- README files are entry points for humans; use linked docs for full detail.
