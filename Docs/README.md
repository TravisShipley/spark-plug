# Docs

This folder contains the project documentation for Spark Plug.

## Start Here

1. `DOCS_GUIDELINES.md` for document roles, metadata conventions, and duplication rules.
2. `Architecture/README.md` for runtime architecture and ownership docs.
3. `Data/README.md` for schema and content-reference docs.
4. `Process/README.md` for operational workflows.
5. `Policies/README.md` for policy documents (including AI policy).
6. `Content/README.md` for content-authoring guidance.

## Notes

- Policy docs are authoritative when they conflict with design/reference/process docs.
- README files are entry points for humans; use linked docs for full detail.
