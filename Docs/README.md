# Docs Read Order

1. `DOCS_GUIDELINES.md`
2. `Policies/AI/AI_README.md`
3. `Architecture/Overview.md`
4. `Architecture/SystemMap.md`
5. `Data/MinimalRuntimeSchema.md`

## Notes

- Policy documents are authoritative when they conflict with design/reference/process docs.
- Keep docs in their intended role to avoid duplication.
